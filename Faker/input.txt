Scientific research and development remains important in the universities of England, with many establishing science parks to facilitate production and co-operation with industry.[163] Cambridge is the most intensive research cluster for science and technology in the world.[164] In 2022, the UK produced 6.3 per cent of the world's scientific research papers and had a 10.5 per cent share of scientific citations, the third highest in the world (after the United States and China).[165] Scientific journals produced in England include Nature, the British Medical Journal and The Lancet. The Department for Science, Innovation and Technology, Secretary of State for Science, Innovation and Technology, and Minister of State for Science, Research and Innovation has responsibility for science in England.[166]
